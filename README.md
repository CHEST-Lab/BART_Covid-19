# BART_Covid-19
Here we provide a brief overview of our procedure with the key methods used in our analysis.
Note, that we do not provide the processing of the OSM data. 


### Age_Estimation.R
The age groups from the official census data (INKAR) were different from those of the RKI. Therefore, a probabilistic age estimation has been applied. 

A empirical distribution function has been applied to estimate the probability of the RKI age groups:

The comparison for whole Germany between the original and the estimated distributions is shown here:

### BART_machine.R
Here we provide a brief overview of our key analysis method used in our analysis.
Due to random seeds, results may vary to a limited degree.
Users can set serialize=TRUE in the bartMachine() function to save a specific model for a new session.

A full explanation is provided within the script.
